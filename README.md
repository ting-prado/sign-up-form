# Sign-up Form

## Introduction

This project is intended to practice what I've learned on the intermediate HTML and CSS lessons. The goal of this project is to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

## Goals and Objectives

* Create a sign-up form with the layout the same as this [image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png)
* Pick an external font for the logo section
* Add form validation
* Make page responsive

## Skills Emphasized in this Project

* Flexbox
* CSS Properties
* CSS Selectors
* Positioning
* Text and Element Styles
* Page responsiveness
* Custom Properties
* Form Basics
* Form Validation

## Thoughts After Completion

This project is kinda a challenging one specially when it came to the responsiveness design of the page. I've also become more comfortable and familiar in using advanced CSS selectors and form validation using the Constraint Validition API. Overall, I am satisfied with the final output of the project.
